# Clock-timer-alarm-stopwatch
Project in JS, HTML, CSS. <br />
Using vanilla Javascript (ES6). Best HTML5 practices and CSS3 stylings. <br />

Interesting practices used:
- DOM manipulations;
- BEM methodology;
- XMLHttpRequests;
- MutationObserver API;
- Asynchronous functions;
- Fetch API;
- GitHub API;
- JS modules. <br />

Todo list:
- check if Daylight Saving Time is in effect and it's chamge time depending on that;
- drag and drop for clockList and alarmList;
- adapt for mobile devices;
- fix addition of "scrolling" class to menu when lists' scrollHeight are not overlapping clientHeight. <br />
